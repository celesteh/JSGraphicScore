# JSGraphicScore
This script generates a simple graphic score useful for teaching. 
It can be cut and paste into a Moodle page.

## How to use for teaching
This is designed for students who have no experience of graphic scores, so
they get more comfortable and can begin to think of how they might approach
something like _Treatise_ by Cardew.

I suggest you start with one note and only dots on one line and have 
students discuss how they might interpret it and try playing a few versions. 

Then add flat lines to it and discuss how they might interpret those as well as
the dots and play a few versions.

After they feel comfortable with that add either lines (the far right box) 
or notes or both.  They may decide to divide the group so that they treat it as
if they are reading parts in a score. Or they may decide to may notes to
page position.

Finally, see what they do with circles. Is it related to timbre? To amplitude?
To something else?

## Using with Moodle
Open JSGraphicScore.html in a plan text editor. Look for a line near the top:  
```<!-- Start Pasting from this line for Moodle -->``` and a line at the bottom:
``` <!-- Stop Pasting from this line for Moodle -->```. Select everything
between those lines and copy it in to your clipboard.

On Moodle, turn editing on. Go to the section where you would like to make 
the page and click on "Add an activity or resource." Selected "Page".

Give the page a title. The second big box is the Content Box. Click on the â†´ 
button. More buttons will appear. Then click on the </> button.

Select everthing in the large text area and paste in the contents of your 
clipboard.

Click the "Save and Display" button to see if it worked.
