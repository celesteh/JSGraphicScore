# JSGraphicScore
This script generates a simple graphic score useful for teaching. 
It can be cut and paste into a Moodle page.

## Using with Moodle
Open JSGraphicScore.html in a plan text editor. Look for a line near the top:  
```<!-- Start Pasting from this line for Moodle -->``` and a line at the bottom:
``` <!-- Stop Pasting from this line for Moodle -->```. Select everything
between those lines and copy it in to your clipboard.

On Moodle, turn editing on. Go to the section where you would like to make 
the page and click on "Add an activity or resource." Selected "Page".

Give the page a title. The second big box is the Content Box. Click on the â†´ 
button. More buttons will appear. Then click on the </> button.

Select everthing in the large text area and paste in the contents of your 
clipboard.

Click the "Save and Display" button to see if it worked.
